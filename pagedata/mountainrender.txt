The basic principle behind the Mountain Render is that everything is based around the material.
I used the Landscape generator again to create the mountain and then it was material work from there. The simple
premise is that there are two materials, the snow, and the stone. And then I use some fancy nodes to only have the snow
sit on the top. The thing is, however, that by itself doesn't look all that great so the other group of nodes is a noise
texture that covers the whole mountain. I then mixed between both of those to create the final effect. I think it turned
out, passable one thing that I don't like about it is that at times there is too much detail/bumps and that detail is
very repetitive at the same time. But I was able to hide some it in the shadows and clouds that I put onto the render
after the fact.
