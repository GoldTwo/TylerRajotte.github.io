All this project is that it is a quick and dirty test to see the viability of
different separation methods. The first method that I tried was a difference key. I
actually came up with the idea of separating a subject from the background using
the difference of the pixels before I ever heard of a difference key. But after
some looking around I discovered that it was a thing that was already included in
the latest version of After Effects. So there goes my idea of using an image
processing library in Python and going frame by frame and comparing each pixel. But
as you can see the results are less than stellar, maybe I had the settings wrong but
it seemed no matter what I did it was around that bad. The next method that I tried
was simply using a green screen but the key feature was that I would do it all at
the exact same location so the lighting would be identical and that worked for the most part, except I was probably was standing too close to it and it then casted a
shadow on me. So more distance plus a bit of colour correction would probably help a
bit. Other than the two methods that I showed here there are some others on the table
as well. Rotoscoping will always give the best results but the time and effort put in
are crazy at times, there also is the roto brush tool in After Effects that takes some of the pains of rotoscoping away but can also cause some of its own.
