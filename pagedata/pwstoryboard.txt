This project is one part of a way greater project that I have. This whole project is to create a whole animated short
around this one song. The song was created by a guy that goes by the name of Levi Niha and in his video he remixes all of
the windows sounds together to make a song. Well, I heard this song and I was immediately struck with a magnitude of ideas
of the different scenes and how the whole animated short would look and feel. So I'm jumping on it and this is just the
storyboard of what I hope eventually becomes a whole animated short. As for the video itself, I drew everything in Photoshop
and put it all into a timeline on After Effects. As for the future I plan on uploading each scene as an individual project
going forward.
