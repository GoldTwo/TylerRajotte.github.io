This project was finished quite a while ago but I never did get around to rendering it until now.
The model behind all of this is just a stretched cube and everything else is in the material. When it comes to the
material it can be broken into three sections, glass, building and light. The way the glass was done is that I have a separate
"Texture" that I use to determine what should have glass and what should not using a mix shader. And the glass itself is just
the default glass shader built into blender. The building material is just a principled bdsf with the regular texture as the colour and the light is an emission shader. To control the emission I just ramp the regular texture so that I only have the
bright parts of the image and then I feed it all into the control of the mix shader. Besides this, the final material that is
used in Scene 1 will also have some fancy selections that determine whats the top and then place roof textures there. Pretty cool
for just a material that could be applied onto anything.
