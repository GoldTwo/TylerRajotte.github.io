This ink drop project took long than expected and it wasn't just render time. That is because this one project turned into two behind the scenes more about that later.
The basic principal behind the effect is that there is a sphere that emits smoke and the "drop" part is just the sphere moving. And because I like having my computer tied up for long periods of time instead of doing only one source I did 6 and animated the camera moving through all of them. When it comes to the material for the smoke I doubled up the density property so that the density controlled the hue
of the smoke creating the purple and pink mix. This is where the two projects in one
part comes in because I had everything ready to go, the smoke baked and everything
else setup but after it rendered there were a few problems. The whole thing played too fast and the camera was too zoomed in. So I went and fixed those and I resimulated it and rendered the whole thing over again. You might ask yourself,
"So, whats the big deal?" Well the thing is that the simulation generates about 10 -20 gigabytes of data and the render time is roughly a day at the minimum. But complaining aside this is project that im pretty happy with in the end of everything.
