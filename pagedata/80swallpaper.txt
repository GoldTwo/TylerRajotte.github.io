Hello there I am writing about this wallpaper that I made and I really enjoy 
this. I made it all in blender obviously and It actually really came out
better than anything I could ever hope for. I started out by using the
landscape plugin to generate the mountains that you see at the sides. After
that I then created the bottom floor but only to the middle because then 
I used a mirror modifier and also applied it. I then labourisly went through
and connected the seam down the middle becuase I had genrated a long section
of mountains to help make it look less repeated. I then used a porpotial edit
on the boundry were the flat ground meet the mountains to randomly pull up
the surrounding polygons and to add more detail to the scene. Then came the
big part.
