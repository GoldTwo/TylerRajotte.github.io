For this render I was inspired by the many wallpaper that are almost identical to
the final product. To start I first generated a long stretch of mountain with the
landscape generator plugin. I then extract out the ground plane to about the middle point where I then followed it up with a mirror modifier and after manualy connected the two which took a while to say the least. I then used the random propotinal edit ing tool to create the random bumps in the road to make the transtition between the
side and floor less jarring. I then duplicated my work and used the wireframe modifier to create the wireframe look. After creating the materials I used the compositiong tools to create the bloom effect and then I rendered the final product.
