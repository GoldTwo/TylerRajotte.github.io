This is the first of what im calling the Random Render series. With this render I just wanted to model something apply a neat looking
material. So thats exactly what I did I modeled the sword and then applied a material that made it all metal but depending how
you where looking at it it would change colour. I then applied my first texture in blender to create the wood plank floor. I used
all of the maps that I got from my texture when I downloaded it and by the end the material node viewer looked like a plate of pasta.
