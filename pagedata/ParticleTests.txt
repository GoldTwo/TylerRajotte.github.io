The whole purpose behind these "Tests" was that I wanted to learn how to
actually make a particle system in blender. The reason why I wanted to learn
is that I want to use a particle system to generate random clutter on the
streets in the first scene for Project Windows. The first test was the falling
monkey heads. This was just so I could get a sense of particle systems in the
first place. The second test, the forest, I did so I could get the hang of
placing objects on a surface. The third was me messing around with boids
which are like small bacteria in the way they interact and move amongst
themselves. Finally the fourth is me putting everything together and using
a hair system to eventually create my clutter. The nice thing with the hair
system is that it can be groomed. So I will have some control over the clutter
so it's not spawning in the middle of the roads and such.
