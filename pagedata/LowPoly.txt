Other than the tutorial Donughnut that everyone makes this was my first project that I did in Blender
This project was overall fairly simple but came out looking overall pretty decent. The first and the best
looking object that I did was the tree. With the tree I started out with a cylinder and went from there. I 
did the roots shooting out of the bottom first then forked the top and added a deformed isosphere on top. For
materials I just picked simple colors and left everything else default and then added one of the sky presets
built into blender so the tree wasn't left out in a black void. For the other two the barrel was simple enough to
make and I instead used some noise in the materials to make the wood look more like wood. And for the lamp I used 
the built in glass and tried to make metal but it didn't work out too well. The harder thing with the lamp however
was rendering where I couldn't get rid of the dreaded "Fire Flies" in ended up adjusting one of the clamp settings
and that seemed to solve most of the problems.
