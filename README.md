Da30 Website

This is the code for my Digital Arts Profile, but its more than just a simple site. I also built a whole python backend that acts in the same way PHP I think would. The only differnce is that its a bit more specialized for my singular use case, If you have a use for my python script in your own site go right ahead and use it might be handy for a blog or something closer to what im doing. Your going to want to look for the template variables in the code and replace it with your own html and overall the whole script could be perhalps layed out a bit better but it gets the job done. Also any hope for comments should rest in peace.

Uses GitPython for pushing the new code to a git repo and uses specific folder and file names
