After doing some picture renders I decided to move into the world of video and to start I decided that I wanted to make a flaming sword. So I reused the model from my previous Random Render and used that as the starting base. So I began to set up all the different things to start simulating the fire and smoke. Once I had everything ready to simulate I got my sign that this project was going to take some processing time. Because simulating everything alone took a whole night. Once that was done I moved onto getting the fire material ready to go. Once that was done little did I know that a day and a half of rendering was waiting for me and in total it took roughly 36 hours on my GTX 1070 to completely render for about 5 seconds of animation. So about 20 minutes per frame.
