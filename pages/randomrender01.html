This is the first of what I'm calling the Random Render series. With this render, I just wanted to model something to apply a neat looking material I had seen created. So that's exactly what I did I modeled the sword and then applied a material that made it all metal but depending on how you were looking at it it would change colour. I then applied my first texture in Blender to create the wood plank floor. I used all of the maps that I got from my texture when I downloaded it and by the end, the material node viewer looked like a plate of pasta.
