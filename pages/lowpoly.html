Other than the tutorial Doughnut that everyone makes this was the first project that I did in Blender This project was overall fairly simple but came out looking overall pretty decent. The first and the best looking object that I did was the tree. With the tree, I started out with a cylinder and went from there. I  did the roots shooting out of the bottom first then forked the top and added a deformed isosphere on top. For materials, I just picked simple colors and left everything else default and then added one of the sky presets built into Blender so the tree wasn't left out in a black void. For the other two, the barrel was simple enough to make and I instead used some noise in the materials to make the wood look more like wood. And for the lamp, I used the built-in glass and tried to make metal but it didn't work out too well. The harder thing with the lamp, however, was rendering where I couldn't get rid of the dreaded "Fire Flies" in ended up adjusting one of the clamp settings and that seemed to solve most of the problems.
